This is a fix for legacy CPU system in order to play Rainbow Six Siege without annoying stuttering in game. Press END key when you are in game and the script will make it enjoyable again :)
All it does is to set the main process to the first core and assign it again to all cores. This will do the trick!
My CPU: Intel i5 6600
